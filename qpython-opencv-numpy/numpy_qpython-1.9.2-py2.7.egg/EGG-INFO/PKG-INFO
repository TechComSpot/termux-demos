        From it's website:
        
        NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. It contains among other things:
        
        a powerful N-dimensional array object
        sophisticated (broadcasting) functions
        tools for integrating C/C++ and Fortran code
        useful linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random number capabilities
        Besides its obvious scientific uses, NumPy can also be used as an efficient multi-dimensional container of generic data. Arbitrary data-types can be defined. This allows NumPy to seamlessly and speedily integrate with a wide variety of databases.
